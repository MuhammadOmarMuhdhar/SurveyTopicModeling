    This prototype represents my first attempt in exploring how machine learning and NLP can be used to address the challenge of analyzing qualitative
                        survey data at scale. 

    I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions to improve this tool!

    **This prototype tool is designed to transform open-ended survey responses into clear quantitative insights.**

    By leveraging natural language processing, unsupervised machine learning algorithms, and advanced large language models, this tool 
    enables the large-scale analysis of qualitative data. It organizes unstructured survey responses into coherent and semantically meaningful clusters, 
    providing concise summaries and insights that uncover key themes and highlight underlying patterns in responses.

    The goal is to bridge the gap between traditional manual analysis of open-ended surveys and modern machine learning techniques, 
    offering an intuitive platform for extracting objective insights from complex qualitative data.
